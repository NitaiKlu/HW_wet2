*   //For now, Select will use ind=rank_size+1, meaning the
    //"normal" rank (representing the index, if the tree was a sorted array)
    //Because we could have two nodes with the same rank in regard to ind=/=rank_size+1 
    //=>
    //int Select(int rank, int ind) const;
    int Select(int rank) const;
